  * Localizes a file according to the rules in the spec:

  * - two input files with the same name must be located separately, to avoid name collision
  * - two input files that originated in the same storage directory must also be localized into
  *   the same directory for task execution
  * @param rootDir the root dir - files are localize to subdirectories under this directory
  * @param existingPaths optional Set of paths that should be assumed to already exist locally
  * @param separateDirsBySource whether to always separate files from each source dir into
  *                             separate target dirs (true), or to minimize the number of
  *                              dirs used by putting all files in a single directory by default
  *                              but create additional directories to avoid name collision.
  * @param subdirPrefix prefix to add to localization dirs
  * @param disambiguationDirLimit max number of disambiguation subdirs that can be created
